# GitHub Copilot - Project Notes for ta-cukrarna

## Project Overview

- **Name**: ta-cukrarna (Ta CukrÃ¡rna - "The Bakery")
- **Framework**: Next.js 16 + React 19 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Structure**: App Router (app/ directory)
- **Export**: Static export enabled (since yesterday)
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/jiripech/ta-cukrarna

## Development Workflow

### Preferred Approach
- **STRUCTURED ANALYTICAL APPROACH**: Always analyze problems systematically before attempting solutions
- **NO random junior attempts**: Research root cause first, then implement targeted solution
- **Use systematic debugging**: Logs, error analysis, configuration review before making changes

### Server Management
- **Use screen for development server**: `screen -S nextjs-dev -d -m npm run dev`
- **Access running server**: `screen -r nextjs-dev`
- **Detach from screen**: `Ctrl+A, D`
- **Kill server**: `screen -S nextjs-dev -X quit`
- **Why**: Prevents server interruption during terminal operations

### Current Favicon Issue
- **Problem**: Next.js auto-generates favicon link: `/favicon.ico?favicon.0b3bf435.ico`
- **Root cause**: Next.js detects favicon files and creates automatic metadata
- **RESOLVED**: Fixed Turbopack/webpack config conflict in `next.config.ts`
- **Solution**: Replaced webpack config with `turbopack: {}` configuration
- **Files setup**:
  - `public/icon.ico` (our custom favicon)
  - `public/apple-touch-icon.png` (Apple touch icon)
  - Removed `public/favicon.ico` to prevent auto-detection

## Implementation Status

### Completed âœ…
- [x] Basic layout and responsive design
- [x] PWA configuration (manifest.json, service worker)
- [x] Contact information in footer
- [x] Hydration error fixed (removed DynamicSections)
- [x] Image component aspect ratio warning fixed
- [x] Custom favicon files created and configured
- [x] Service Worker cache updated

### Current Issue ðŸ”§
- **Favicon not displaying**: Chrome shows Vercel logo instead of custom favicon
- **Technical cause**: Next.js automatic favicon generation overrides manual links
- **Next step**: Configure next.config.ts to disable automatic favicon handling
