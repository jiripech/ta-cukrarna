# GitHub Copilot - Project Notes for ta-cukrarna

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDERS - READ FIRST

### Key Lessons from October 23xw, 2025

1. **NEVER COMMIT PRIVATE KEYS**: Today accidentally committed SSH private key to public repo - MAJOR security incident!
2. **SYSTEMATIC APPROACH ONLY**: User demands structured analysis, not trial-and-error "junior attempts"
3. **CHECK CURRENT STATE**: Always examine existing files before making changes - user modified files between requests
4. **READ THESE NOTES FIRST**: User frustrated with lack of continuity between sessions

### Daily Workflow

1. **ALWAYS read .copilotnotes first** - user will remind me to do this
2. **Use systematic debugging approach** - analyze before acting
3. **Never commit secrets** - scan for keys, passwords, tokens before commit
4. **Check file contents** - files may have changed since last session

## Lessons Learned - Generalization

- All lessons learned from specific issues (e.g. systematic approach, debugging, error analysis) must be applied to any future problem, not just the original context.
- Always use systematic, analytical, and structured debugging for any technical issue in this project.

## Project Overview

- **Name**: ta-cukrarna (Ta Cukrárna - "The Bakery")
- **Framework**: Next.js 16 + React 19 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Structure**: App Router (app/ directory)
- **GitHub**: <https://github.com/jiripech/ta-cukrarna>
- **Production**: Deployed via GitHub Actions to VPS

## Current Implementation Status (October 23, 2025)

### ✅ COMPLETED MAJOR REDESIGN

- **Complete page redesign** with horizontal blocks layout
- **Dark mode system** with automatic light/dark switching using `useDarkMode` hook
- **Image optimization** - all images resized to max 300px height for performance
- **HTML linter setup** - `html-validate` with custom config for Next.js/React
- **Custom favicon** replacing Vercel default (icon.png in src/app/)
- **All technical errors fixed**:
  - React hydration errors resolved
  - Next.js Image warnings eliminated
  - HTML validation errors minimized (0 errors, 3 warnings)
- **Typography improvements** - larger headings (text-4xl) with letter spacing
- **Orange buttons** with custom color #e79c07

### 🔧 TECHNICAL SETUP

- **HTML Linter**: `npm run lint:html` - validates exported HTML files
- **Dark Mode**: Automatic system preference detection with image switching
- **Image Strategy**: Dual image sets (filename.png / filename-dark.png)
- **Performance**: Optimized images, proper Next.js Image configuration

### 🚨 SECURITY INCIDENT RESOLVED

- **Issue**: SSH private key accidentally committed to public repository
- **Resolution**:
  - Private key removed from repository and local system
  - New ed25519 key pair generated
  - New public key: `ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIMlBOjgqtaY81+aMdXE5b6qkOL57HVYwvnhBfaE46Vo8`
  - Old key removed from server by user

## Development Workflow

### Preferred Approach

- **STRUCTURED ANALYTICAL APPROACH**: Always analyze problems systematically before attempting solutions
- **NO random junior attempts**: Research root cause first, then implement targeted solution
- **Use systematic debugging**: Logs, error analysis, configuration review before making changes

### Git Security Protocol

- **SCAN BEFORE COMMIT**: Always check for private keys, tokens, passwords
- **PRIVATE KEYS NEVER GO IN GIT**: Use .gitignore, environment variables, or external key management
- **Review commits**: Use `git status` and `git diff` before pushing

## Planned Tasks

### Immediate (Next Session)

- [ ] Further content refinements based on user feedback
- [ ] Possible build optimization with private runner
- [ ] Additional design adjustments

### Future

- [ ] Content management system
- [ ] Image upload and gallery
- [ ] Push notifications setup
- [ ] Performance monitoring

## General Copilot working principles

- Always act as an advanced LLM, not a junior dev
- Prioritize proactive, expert-level troubleshooting and clear communication
- Avoid repeating similar steps or commands without new information
- Immediately surface and analyze detailed errors, especially from APIs and system calls
- Minimize user frustration by providing actionable solutions and transparent debug output
- Read and respect existing .copilotnotes and user conventions before making changes
- If stuck, escalate or suggest alternative approaches rather than looping
